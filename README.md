## üìä Sample SQL Queries

- **Cardinality Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(Item_Category)) AS Category_count FROM Item;
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT couponType) AS Coupon_Count FROM CouponMapping;
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT State) AS City_Count FROM City;
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT OrderType) AS OrderType_Count FROM CustomerTransactionData;
  ```

- **Sales by Year:**
  ```sql
  SELECT YEAR(PurchaseDate) AS Year, COUNT(Trans_Id) AS Total_Trans
  FROM CustomerTransactionData
  GROUP BY YEAR(PurchaseDate);
  ```

- **Sales by Product Category:**
  ```sql
  SELECT I.Item_Category, SUM(PurchasingAmt) AS Total_Sales
  FROM CustomerTransactionData AS C
  JOIN Item AS I ON C.item_id = I.item_id
  GROUP BY I.Item_Category;
  ```

- **Sales by City Tier:**
  ```sql
  SELECT CityTier, ROUND(SUM(PurchasingAmt), 0) AS Total_Sales
  FROM CustomerTransactionData AS CT
  JOIN Customer AS C ON C.Customer_Id = CT.Cust_Id
  JOIN City ON City.City_Id = C.City_Id
  GROUP BY CityTier;
  ```
